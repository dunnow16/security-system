David Bizzocchi, Owen Dunn

**Tested with a small scale "room" (large wooden box) that included:**
1. A microcontroller connected to a custom circuit board and components to host the code
2. A solenoid to ring a bell (a single doorbell pipe) in case of alarm (fire or open door/window)
3. A temperature sensor to detect a fire
4. A motion sensor to sense an open window or door
5. A keypad to require a pin to enter without alarm and to turn off the alarm
6. A small led screen was used to display and check different status information and see all history.
